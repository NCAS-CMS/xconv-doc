The **Field and dimension names** interface is used to change the long,
short, standard and unit names for the currently selected field and it's
dimensions. If long, short, standard or unit name is changed for the x, y or z
dimension then any other fields which have the same dimension names and values, 
will also be changed. 

The **Apply** button must be clicked for any name changes to take effect.
The **Reset** button will reset the field, dimension and unit names
to either their initial state if **Apply** has not yet been used or to the
state they were in when **Apply** was last used.
